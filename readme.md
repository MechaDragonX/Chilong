# Chilong

## What is Chilong?
Chilong is a program that sets Discord Rich Presence (RPC) status for [SumatraPDF](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf), a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) reader application that can read `*.pdf`, [`*.epub`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB), [`*.mobi`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats#Mobipocket), and [comic book archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_archive) (`*.cbz`, `*.cbr`, `*.cb7`, etc.), among other files. It uses [Lachee's C# Discord RPC](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp) library to set RPC.

## How do I run it?
You can get the latest binary from the [releases tab](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Chilong/releases). Chilong runs on it's own and is entirely seperate from SumatraPDF. **This is not a plugin. Chilong works with portable and installer-based versions of SumatraPDF for Windows.**

## Is it functional?
At the moment it should be... Check the [issues](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Chilong/issues) tab for any issues.

## What the hell is this name?
SumatraPDF is named after the tropical island of [Sumatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra) in Indonesia, so I decided to go with a southeast/east Asian inspiration for my name. In southeast and east Asian mythology and Chinese folk religion, there are 4 [Dragon Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_King) (四海龍王, Sìhǎi Lóngwáng). They, along with the [Yellow Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Dragon) (黃龍, Huánglóng) maintain peace and harmony in the universe. The Dragon King of the south, is known as the Red Dragon (赤龍 [Chìlóng] or 朱龍 [Zhūlóng], literally "Cinnabar Dragon", "Vermilion Dragon"). He is the parton of the South China Sea, which borders Sumatra, and is associated with summer and fire, which fits Sumatra being a hot, tropical island.

## When will this be done?
Well...it's functional, but it doesn't look the way I want it to or have all the features I want it to...so let's say it's *in progress*.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to [BloodDragooner](https://github.com/BloodDragooner) for the idea and help with testing!
